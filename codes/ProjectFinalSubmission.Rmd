# Analysis of Financial Independence

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
### Reading the Database and Exploring it

# Setting the working directory so that we do not have to change the location in each user's laptop

# By default, the current working directory is at the codes folder after getwd(), 
# so using dirname on the codes dir gets the parent directory i.e. the base folder
work_dir <- dirname(getwd())
work_dir
# Data resides inside the data folder ->
filepath <- paste(work_dir, "/data/reddit_finance.csv", sep = "")

fin_df <- read.csv(filepath)
head(fin_df, 10)

dim(fin_df)

str(fin_df)

```
